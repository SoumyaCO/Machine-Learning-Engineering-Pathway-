# Machine Learning Operations Specialization
## 📚 Courses:
1. 🐍 [Python Essential For MLOps](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-mlops-duke?specialization=mlops-machine-learning-duke)
    * logic, assigning variable, different data structure
    * Write, Run and Debug tests using **Pytest** to validate the work
    * Interact with API/SDK to build commandline tools and HTTP APIs to solve and automate Machine Learning problems.
2. 🔄 [DevOps, DataOps and MLOps](https://www.coursera.org/learn/devops-dataops-mlops-duke?specialization=mlops-machine-learning-duke)
    * Build operations pipeline using DevOps, DataOps, and MLOps
    * Explain the principle and practices of MLOps (*i.e.*, data management, model training and development, continuous integration and delivery(**CI/CD**) etc.)
    * Build and **Deploy** machine Learning models in a production environment using MLOps tools and platforms.
3. 🤖 [MLOps Platforms: Amazon Sagemaker and Azure ML](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mlops-aws-azure-duke?specialization=mlops-machine-learning-duke)
    * Apply exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to data science problems and datasets.
    * Build machine learning modelling solutions using both AWS and **Azure technology 🆓** (👈 preferred way to go bcz)
    * train and deploy machine learning solutions to a production environment using cloud technology

4. 🤗 [MLOps Tools: MLFlow and HuggingFace](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mlops-mlflow-huggingface-duke?specialization=mlops-machine-learning-duke)
    * Create new MLFlow projects to create and register models.
    * Use hugginf Face models and datasets to build your own APIs.
    * **Package and deploy** Hugging Face to the Cloud using automation


## 😋 Probable Outcomes:
* Know in depth about automating machine learning engineering tasks (from course 1)
* Complete workflow of DevOps, DataOps and MLOps
* Idea of CI/CD
* Whole process of deploying a model in the cloud
* Making an API via packaging model and deploying in the cloud

## 🔎 Plan of Action:
* Rather than reading books, its a good resource to get a closer look at the MLOps process
* Rather than overwathcing the course and the codes $\rightarrow$ Taking this course in doses and taking break between is a good strategy
* MLOps is necessary but to build knowledge around machine learning algorithms one should do:
    * Learn about many **Machine Learning/Deep Learning** techniques;
        * Classification (multiclass and binary)
        * Regression
        * Clustering
        * Recommender System
        * Computer Vision
            * Image/Video segmentation
            * Image/Video classification
            * Image/Video localisation
        * Natural Language Processing
            * *More Details comming soon(I've not started it. he he)*
        * Generative AI
        * Reinforcement Learning
    * **Compete** on Kaggle
        * Participate in the competitions
        * Submit solutions
        * Learn about the problem and solution:
            * from other's notebooks
            * Research Papers
            * Youtube Videos
        * Do the Basic EDA atleast
        * Know the data and play with it.
        * Visualize it
    * **Hunt for good notebooks and Datasets everyday**
        * Search for codes of your interested problems
            * you can learn from it
            * advance code snippits
            * advance function
            * advance EDA technique etc...
        * Search for interesting datasets
            * Do analysis post in linkedin and github
            * Do machine learning on newly learned topics
            * See other's code on this same dataset
        * At least 1 comments in a day.
            * Comment on a post/code/dataset
            * Share your thoughts/tips
            * Give suggestions/upvotes to others aswell.
    * Create good tutorial notebooks on good topics.

## 📄 Daily Routine for now:
1. Spend Time on Kaggle
    * Comment on posts
    * watch other's codes
    * Watch for some interesting datasets to work on
    * Learn different algorithms from 🔗["Kaggle/learn"](https://www.kaggle.com/learn)
2. Do the MLOps course
3. Build something new? -> Post on a blog post, LinkedIN (about the project)
4. Done something new(new notebook, analysis, model) -> Post on LinkedIN
5. Register all of your knowledge in a youtube channel. (After Completing MLOps Course)

## 🚦 Postpone for now:
1. reading lots of machine learning books in a daily basis
2. Datacamp pandas, python toolkit etc. courses -> **extremely necessary** for the skills -> **SQL, Data analysis, advance data vosualization and so on** , also **Certificate** is very necessary.
3. DSA and LeetCode

## 💡 Tips to Stick to a plan:
1. Internet is a vast place and has lots of resources on Machine Learning (probably infinite no. of contents on different concepts and goals.) Each course is equally enjoying and interesting also.
2. Who is a good machine Learning Engineer?
    * One who has done many courses 😑
    * One who has done many things by pretty much himself.
3. Stick to a course and then start to make things, build things -> don't look for another advance projects
4. For clearing concepts on a specific topic youtube can be a tool

## Long Term Plan:
1. Become a **4X expert** in Kaggle
2. Build at least **5 Machine Learning Major Project**s which will be live all the time.
3. Make a **Portfolio** Website with React (I'll learn React)
4. EARN **CERTIFICATES**
    * FREE:
        * NVIDIA -> *Disaster Risk Prediction Certificate*
        * Hugging Face -> *Reinforcement Learning certificate*
        * Kaggle Certificates -> *On interesting Courses (like, Time-series, cnn, JAX, geospatial data)*
        * *Search for other free certificates*

    * PAID: (cost: low to high)
        * DATACAMP -> Certificate
        * Coursera [machine Learning certificates]
        * Tensorflow Developer
        * Google/AWS/Azure Machine Learing Engineer Certificate

5. DSA in leetcode

## Advacne things: SomeDay:
1. Machine Learning with JS
2. Pytorch
3. tensorflow advacne technique
4. Tensorflow lite for edge devices
